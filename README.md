#  Virtual IT Infrastructure Lab (Internship Project)

As part of my IT internship, I designed and deployed a secure virtual lab environment to simulate a small business IT infrastructure. I used a combination of Windows Server and Linux systems with real-world tools to practice system administration, networking, automation, and cybersecurity.
